          <p>Family Map was a project for my CS240 class at BYU. That class had only major projects - the family map server and the family map client, and they were related to each other.</p>
<h2 id="Family-Map-Client"><a href="#Family-Map-Client" class="headerlink" title="Family Map Client"></a>Family Map Client</h2><p>I created an Android App (a preview seen in the picture above) that would display the family relationships of a user. The information was generated by the Family Map server. I created an app that would be able to respond to user interaction, used asycrous tasks to communicate with the server, and that followed a MVC (model-view-controller) pattern. I learned about a lot of Android terms and coding practices, including - views, fragments, textviews, recyclerviews, Google Map Fragments, and more.</p>
<h2 id="Family-Map-Server"><a href="#Family-Map-Server" class="headerlink" title="Family Map Server"></a>Family Map Server</h2><p>I created a server in Java that would communicate to the Family Map Client. It used a SQLite database, and followed good software principles.</p>
<ol>
<li>Single Responsibility Rule - we had to divide our code into multiple classes that did one thing. Ihad a ServerProxy class that would act as the Client and make calls to the server by taking arguments, making them into JSON, and creating an HTTP connection to our server with the JSON. I also created HttpHandlers, which would parse the JSON, turn it into Java models, and give those models to the server’s services. There were services for each of my API calls which would do all the algorithmic work that was needed for the API. And finally I created DAOs (Data Access Objects) whose primary job was to communicate to the SQLite database. </li>
<li>Unit testing - for my DAO objects and my Server Proxy, I created unit tests that made sure that each class and its public methods worked as it should. These unit tests then could be used for regression testing, to make sure that the project didn’t break along the way.</li>
<li>Reduced code duplication - I reduced code duplication by making sure that repeated work was put into functions, and if needed, I used inheritance and polymorphism to reduce more code duplication. The inheritance was primariliy used for catching and handling any and all errors that would occur while the server was being run.</li>

          <p>byutv.org is the digital media platform that BYU Broadcasting uses to distribute all their digitally available content. </p>
<p>BYUTV2 was version 2 of the website, and BYUTV3 is the version 3 of the website. BYUTV3 was meant to be newer, responsive, mobile friendly, and more capable of new customer demands. It focused on having lists to display the content. </p>
<div class="col-12 mb-4"><br>    <p class="portfolio-content-center"> BYUTV2 </p><br>    <img class="img-fluid post-img" src="/images/tv2_screenshot.jpg"><br></div><br><div class="col-12 mb-4"><br>    <p class="portfolio-content-center"> BYUTV3 </p><br>    <img class="img-fluid post-img" src="/images/tv3_screenshot.jpg"><br></div>

<p>I came as a developer for the platform of the BYUTV3 website. I developed with tools such as Git, Jira, BitBucket, SourceTree, Visual Studio, and ElasticSearch. I developed using C#, using Cassandra as the database to store all the data. </p>
<p>As part of the platform group, all of our work was to help our UI group and Content Management Group (CMS) get all the data they needed to create a responsive and dynamic website. </p>
<p>My work included:</p>
<ol>
<li>Developing and maintaining over 200 APIs. <ol>
<li>I created APIs to make, get, and delete youtube items from our database. </li>
<li>I created an API that would save multiple images to our database. We previously had an API that would upload one image, but our CMS wanted to upload multiple images. I coordinated with the CMS team to make sure that our API would read in the right information, and that it would give a correct error message if something went wrong. Due to the nature of the API, if an error occured while uploading an image, the API would continue to upload the other images, while noting that an error occured. At the end of uploading all the images, a new error would be given to the CMS telling them which images had errors. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Using multithreading and asyncounsly programming to optimize the GetListItems API call, reducing it from a 16 second call to a 0.5 second call. In our catalog, we had over 7000 episodes, and we would need to convert them to different models based on the needs of our client. When the list we wanted to get had 15 or fewer items, it was relatively quick. However, if the list had hundreds of items, it took a long time to do it sycronusly. I updated code so that it could read a Cassandra Database asycrously and convert the data from one model type to another asycrounsly, dramatically reducing the call time of the API.</li>
</ol>

          <p>I created this program for CIRA to help detect gaps in the data for the CloudSat satelite in the database located in Fort Collins, CO. The database included the original files from the satelite, and many conversions of that original data into different data formats used by different atmospheric scientists. To convert from one data type to another, certain kinds of files were needed. For example, to create data type GEO, you need just the original data. But to create another data, for example, THERMAL, you need both the original data file and the GEO file. If one of those was missing, you could not create THERMAL. This created a tree like structure, where the children were formed from the parents, and </p>
<p>As CIRA was doing a data inventory, the scientists needed to know which data was missing from the database and why. My program queried the database, and gathered the information it needed from the database. Then it analyzed all the data it gathered. If there was a file that was missing, the program would recursively search for its parent files. From the recursion search, the program would determine why the file was missing - whether it was an algorithm error (aka, the original data from the satelite existed, but somewhere a conversion didn’t happen, causing this file to not be made) or whether this file was missing because the original satelite data was missing. The program would search based on a tree structure file given to it.</p>
<p>As the program ran, it would print out all the files missing, all of its parent files missing, and determine which file was the root cause of the problem, to help the scientists know which data they needed to get and how they could get it.</p>
<p>This program also ran in under a minute, the majority of the time being spent on querying the database for the data, which it then put into a set so that no more queries to the database were needed.</p>

          <p>I created this program to help one of the people on my team, Heather. She had to manage a lot of data from the CloudSat and Calipso (two satelites that collected data for atmosphere scientists.) CIRA at the time was doing a data inventory, organizing and listing what data they had and didn’t have. Heather needed to know which data was missing from her dataset. She asked me to write a program for her. </p>
<p>My program read the files that she had on her computer, and looked at the timestamps on the data, and if there was any data that had very large gaps, I would create a text file saying which files were missing and when, and when the program finished, I would calcuate how many files were missing based on the size of the gaps, and display the total number of files missing and the number of files missing during each month. That way she could check to see if there were no data files at all (aka the satelite was down) or if somehow the data just did not get sent to her. </p>
<p>My program could run with commandline arguments or with user interaction in the console. The user would have to give the folder location of the files, the output location of the textfile, the type of file is should be looking for, and how long each orbit of the satelite was supposed to be in seconds.</p>

          <p>This program was part of a bigger picture at CIRA. CIRA has the CloudSat, is a satelite collecting data and sending it down every 90 minutes to CIRA. CIRA takes that original data and converts it into many other data types. JobBuilder is the pretty much the queue-maker for that data conversion. It creates “jobs” based on the data file given, and a configuration job, and it creates a job to be sent to the queue to be converted by a different program. The program had to query a MySQL database, find the datafiles it needed, and if the files existed, it would create a job with the specifications so that the converter could get the right files and convert them to the file needed.</p>
<p>CIRA had this program already in PHP, but they wanted to have a program with similar functionality in Python, so I created a script, following what they did, making minor changes for the change in the language.</p>

<p>I was part of a technical team for CIRA. They were in charge of the website, managing data for the scientists, and most importantly, collecting and managing data from CloudSat, a satelite that CIRA has had going for over 10 years. I came on as a Web Developer for the website, but was quickly given programming assigments to do in Python. During my two months there, I wrote three programs - JobBuilder, GapAnalyzer, and CalipsoGapDetector.</p>
<p>Working at CIRA was quite fun, and I enjoyed the group I was in a lot. Every Monday and Wednesday at lunch we would play SheepsHead. Its basically the card game hearts, gone crazy. But it was really fun and I learned a lot by being at CIRA.</p>

          <p>I was a missionary for the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons) for two years, May 2014 - May 2016. From July 2015 to January 2016, I was given a special assignment to be the financial secretary for our “mission” or group. A “mission” includes over 180 missionaries, led by a grown man called the Mission President (in case you are wondering, there are over 400 “missions” in the world, I was only part of one of them).</p>
<p>As financial secretary, it was my duty to ensure that the finances of our mission were being spent correctly, handle the payments for the expenses of our mission, and to ensure that we stayed within budget. </p>
<p>One of the most time consuming and taxing jobs was to pay over 50 landlords for housing over 180 missionaries. This process often took many hours to do, and had to be done every month. To speed up the process, I created an iMacro that would read in a CSV with all the landlords information. Then that Imacro would go and automatically create payments to all the landlords by inputting all the landlords payment information into our online system to create payments to all the landlords. The iMacro reduced the time to pay the landlords from 6-10 hours of creating the payments by hand, print the checks, and turn the checks into the bank, to less than an hour, with the computer doing all the work, and all I would do is create the CSV and double check the information before the payment was finalized in case there were any errors. This made my job as Financial Secretary much less time consuming, and for all the Financial Secretaries that would replace me.</p>

          <p>This is a game I created in High School for an art class. As I am not the most artistic person (the best I can draw are stick figures, and even then they aren’t great stick figures) I decided to make a video game instead that would focus on changing the game to make the game more beatiful that longer the player played.</p>
<p>The game is a platform maze game. The exit is hidden, and to find the exit to the level, one aspect of the game will change or “beautify.” For example, in the first level, as you got closer to the exit, the background would change from a black screen to a pretty sky background. My goal was to create a game that would uplift the player through beatification, much like art as a painting or any other form would.</p>
<p>I created the game with the Unity Game Engine and C#. I did all the programming, level design, game design, and game logic outside what the Unity Game Engine provided. As far as the models and assets, those were all provided by friends or the internet.</p>

<p>The idea of Origami Samurai was to have make a game with an origami art style, focusing on the story of a child growing up. Our goal was to learn how to use 3D animation using Blender, making video games through Unity and C#, and in general creating art.</p>
<p>I came on as a progammer, using Unity and C# to make the game. I also learned how to use Blender to create models, textures, rigging, and animation. By my sophomore year, I was the student in charge of the Animation Club. I was responsiblefor trying to get new recruits, teach people how to 3D animate, and bringing together art people and computer people to make a game. As the lead, it my was duty to help motivate people to do their work. It was difficult as many people wanted to have fun than make a videogame. But did make a few full rendered videos and created two levels that could be played, one that showcaded our models, and another tutorial used to introduce a new player to the game. I was also in charge of making the game through Unity and C#. </p>
