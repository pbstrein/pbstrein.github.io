  <h1>Landlord Rent iMacro</h1>

  <p>I was a missionary for the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons) for two years, May 2014 - May 2016. From July 2015 to January 2016, I was given a special assignment to be the financial secretary for our “mission” or group. A “mission” includes over 180 missionaries, led by a grown man called the Mission President (in case you are wondering, there are over 400 “missions” in the world, I was only part of one of them).</p>
<p>As financial secretary, it was my duty to ensure that the finances of our mission were being spent correctly, handle the payments for the expenses of our mission, and to ensure that we stayed within budget. </p>
<p>One of the most time consuming and taxing jobs was to pay over 50 landlords for housing over 180 missionaries. This process often took many hours to do, and had to be done every month. To speed up the process, I created an iMacro that would read in a CSV with all the landlords information. Then that Imacro would go and automatically create payments to all the landlords by inputting all the landlords payment information into our online system to create payments to all the landlords. The iMacro reduced the time to pay the landlords from 6-10 hours of creating the payments by hand, print the checks, and turn the checks into the bank, to less than an hour, with the computer doing all the work, and all I would do is create the CSV and double check the information before the payment was finalized in case there were any errors. This made my job as Financial Secretary much less time consuming, and for all the Financial Secretaries that would replace me.</p>
